### Explain what kinds of contributions you are looking for.

Keep an open mind! Improving documentation, bug triaging, or writing tutorials are all examples of helpful contributions that mean less work for you.

### Explain contributions you are NOT looking for (if any).

Again, defining this up front means less work for you. If someone ignores your guide and submits something you donâ€™t want, you can simply close it and point to your policy.
