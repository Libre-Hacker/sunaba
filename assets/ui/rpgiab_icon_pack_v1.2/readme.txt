This 16x16 icon pack contains 306 colorful, application-oriented icons.
These were created specifically for RPG in a Box (https://www.rpginabox.com) using Adigun Polack's AAP64 palette.
(Check out the engine if you're interested in creating your own grid-based, voxel-style RPGs and adventure games!)

If you'd like to see any specific icons added to this set, please let me know and I'll see what I can do.
These icons are released under the CC BY 4.0 license, so you are free to use or modify them in any manner. Credit would be very much appreciated! :)

If you do use them for anything, let me know as I'd love to see it!
